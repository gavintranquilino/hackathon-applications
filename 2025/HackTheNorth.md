## What is the most exciting thing you've ever built?
```
Hack the North is all about dreaming and building BIG! We're looking for hackers who are enthusiastic and proud of their work, so what's the coolest thing you've ever accomplished? If you have a notable technical project that comes to mind, go for that! If not, any other remarkable passion or initiative you’ve pursued will work!

We’d love to hear about the whole journey - what did you build, why did you build it, and how does it reflect who you are as a builder?

We're looking for a response around 400 words, but feel free to elaborate more if needed!

### Guiding Questions for Your Story:
*Answer these questions as if you're in an interview. Your authentic, spoken-word answers will help craft the final written response.*

1.  **The Spark (The "Why"):** What was the moment you realized this was a problem worth solving? Was it a specific story from a nurse, a patient, or a piece of data that truly struck you? Why did this particular problem resonate with you personally?

2.  **The Team (The "Community"):** You worked with students from health, science, and other engineering fields. What was the most surprising or valuable thing you learned from someone with a completely different background? How did this collaboration change your approach to building?

3.  **The "Aha!" Moment (The "Build"):** Describe the journey from the initial idea to the physical prototype. What was the biggest challenge you faced as a team, and how did you overcome it? Was there a specific moment where you thought, "Wow, this is actually going to work"?

4.  **The Impact (The "Dream Big"):** You pitched this to a representative from Grand River Hospital. Can you describe what that felt like? What did it mean to you to hear that your project was a "completely viable product"?

5.  **The Reflection (The "You"):** This project seems to be about more than just engineering; it's about empathy and simplicity. How has this experience shaped your philosophy as a builder? What does "dreaming big and building" mean to you now?

### Guiding Questions for Your Story:
*Answer these questions as if you're in an interview. Your authentic, spoken-word answers will help craft the final written response.*

1.  **The Spark (The "Why"):** What was the moment you realized this was a problem worth solving? Was it a specific story from a nurse, a patient, or a piece of data that truly struck you? Why did this particular problem resonate with you personally?
"Bariatric and fragile-skin patients face risks like skin tears, pressure ulcers, and injuries due to limitations in current mobility aids.
Existing products lack weight capacity, adjustability, and gentleness, increasing injury risks during care.
Materials and designs often cause friction or shear forces, exacerbating skin damage.
Caregivers experience significant physical strain, leading to injuries and reduced care quality.
There are few cost-effective, durable, and standardized solutions for these specialized needs."
- I have relatives, and family friends who are nurses and work in the medical field, and they have shared stories about the challenges they face with these patients. 
- This specific problem is very close to home for me, since my grandfather who had recently passed away from COVID-19 in 2020 was in a long term care facility and had fragile skin
    - This was actually one of the core problems that he was facing, and I remember his complaints to change rooms, or that the nurses do not turn him enough times in a day
        - Since his body was so weak, he was unable to move himself and often complained about the pain he felt when he was moved like to the bathrooms since they had to use a lift to move him or reposition him in bed
- This specific problem area is very close to home for me, and I wanted to do something about it

2.  **The Team (The "Community"):** You worked with students from health, science, and other engineering fields. What was the most surprising or valuable thing you learned from someone with a completely different background? How did this collaboration change your approach to building?
- I worked with a team of 4 other students and we all came from different faculties.
    - Biomedical Engineering, Nanotechnology Engineering, Biochemistry, and Kinesiology
    - Honestly it was working with people more familiar with medical devices, the rules and regulations in place, helped form the constraints of the project
        - It is so refreshing to work with people who are not from the same background as you 
- Not only that, but actually working with the people who I build for. 
- Speaking with the actual end users, and the people with the pain points, they bring up their concerns and needs which adds onto the scope of the project. Details like what materials to use, the current problems with the current practices, and what they would like to see in a product
    - I think especially in tech industry, it is so easy to get caught up in the technical details and forget about the human aspect of the problem
    - What this taught me was that I need to always keep the end user in mind. Not just put myself in their shoes, but actually talk to them since understanding the problem is everything
        - I find it so useless to build something for the sole purpose of prifit, or to build something that is not solving an actual problem, jsut a REALIZED problem that we as builders imagine up   
- Working around a community of people in medical space validated my thoughts of really building for people. Building what people want
    - BUILD WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT
    - This reminds me of my own philosophy in building. The main reason I come to build is to help real people. Not some soltuion for businesses or corporations, but genuinely end users like the people I grew up around.
        - Its important to me to remember the people I build for are my family, my neighborhood, my community.
            - It's not just about using newest tech to show something flashy, but something that people want
- 

3.  **The "Aha!" Moment (The "Build"):** Describe the journey from the initial idea to the physical prototype. What was the biggest challenge you faced as a team, and how did you overcome it? Was there a specific moment where you thought, "Wow, this is actually going to work"?
- I value simplity
- I value novelty
- I value practicality
- These are my top values when it comes to building
- Coming up with a solution to use inflatable beds was not easy, it took off from just literal chats
    - I remember the first time we had a meeting, and we were brainstorming ideas, we just kept throwing out ideas and see what landed. "what if we rig beds as conveyor belts? cant we move them that way"
        - lots of validation and thinking from teammates in BME and in Kin
    - We kept coming up with convoluted solutions like reinventing the harnessess that carry patients, reinventing the hoyer lifts that carry them, trying to pitch an idea for a new KIND of material to stay breathable
        - Lots of things we tried to do, but nothing stuck due to being impractical, too expensive, or too complex
- One day, on our way to lunch together to do more brainstorming, we passed by a camping store and saw inflatable beds
    - We thought, "what if we used inflatable beds to move patients around? they are light, easy to carry, and can be inflated to the size of a bed"
- It was genuinely a lightbulb moment, and we all agreed that this was the best idea we had so far
    - It's so viable since there are car jacks that literally lift up cars, 
    - Don't need to reinvent the current systems in place in hospitals
        - Talking to the nurses and reps of GRH saying it's too expensive to change the current system or replace so many units
- Breaking down the problem into smaller parts and thinking about what the problem is: "how can we make it easier to reposition patients without causing them or the nurses any pain or stress?"
    - This is the core of the problem and tackling that by genuinely looking around us and seeing what's already available helped us to come up with a solution that is simple, practical, and easy to implement
- We realized that by using inflatable beds, we could create a system that would allow nurses to move patients around without causing them pain or discomfort.
    - Not only would this even work in just a hospital setting, but even at home, working with geriatric patients, and so many more got us even thinking, maybe we can even use these ourselves when need to reposition in bed
        - Coming up with an idea simple, easy to implement, just alittle bit crazy enough really goes to show how creativity allows us to dream big
            - CComing up with a solution like this allowed us to think even more and build ON TOP of this by adding automation, etc. The core principle was key, and us dreaming big allowed us to build on top of that to make it so much more scalable

4.  **The Impact (The "Dream Big"):** You pitched this to a representative from Grand River Hospital. Can you describe what that felt like? What did it mean to you to hear that your project was a "completely viable product"?
- It was honestly a surreal moment knowing that this is completely viable. It doesnn;t just work, but it works so well that it can be implemented in hospitals and long term care facilities without having to replace the current systems in place. No big dents in the budget
    - It was a great feeling to know that our project was not just a concept, but something that could genuinely help people

5.  **The Reflection (The "You"):** This project seems to be about more than just engineering; it's about empathy and simplicity. How has this experience shaped your philosophy as a builder? What does "dreaming big and building" mean to you now?
- My philosophy as a builder has always been about empathy and simplicity.
- This project has reinforced that belief, showing me that the best solutions often come from understanding the needs of the people we build for.
- "Dreaming big and building" means not just creating things that people find cool or technically impressive, but things that genuinely make a difference in people's lives.
    - I want to focus on building for consumers. I want to build for people, not just businesses or corporations.
    - The impact I want to leave on this earth is not just to build things that are impressive and using latest tech, but to build things that genuinely help people and make their lives easier.
    - I don't want to chase prizes, or accolades, or recognition. I want to build things that people genuinely need and want.
        - Hearing the genuinely positive feedback from the nurses and the reps from GRH, it was a great feeling to know that our project was not just a concept, but something that could genuinely help people
- I look up to people building for the future, not building just for the now and building a product that is just a fad or a trend.
- Dreaming big to me means thinking outside the box, being creative, and valuing solutions that are simple, practical, and genuinely helpful.

The most exciting thing I’ve ever built is bAIRiatric Supports, a project born from a desire to solve a problem that’s genuinely personal to me. It’s a system of inflatable air bladders designed to be placed under existing hospital bedsheets, allowing a single nurse to gently reposition patients with the touch of a button. This protects bariatric (obese) patients with fragile skin from painful pressure ulcers and skin tears, while also saving healthcare workers from repetitive physical strain.

In 2020, my late grandfather passed away due to COVID-19. During his time in a long-term care facility, one of his top complaints was the constant pain of being moved. He was too weak to shift on his own, and the process of using lifts, harnesses, or being repositioned to prevent ulcers was torturous for him. His experience drove me to find a more approachable solution; I wanted to build something for him, and for the countless others who share that same vulnerability.

You can't build effective solutions for a community without listening to its members. My technical skills are only one piece of the puzzle. Our team was a diverse mix of students from engineering, biochemistry, and kinesiology, but our most valuable insights came from speaking directly with nurses and patients. This project solidified my core philosophy: build what people actually want, not just what seems technically impressive.

Our "Eureka!" moment happened while passing a camping store. After wrestling with complex ideas, we saw an inflatable mattress and it just clicked. I then led the creation of the physical prototype, integrating servo motors, 3D-printing parts, and working with our biochemist to select breathable, flexible materials. I also developed the full stack mobile + web app using React Native, TypeScript, and NodeJS for our control app, which the nurses praised for its simplicity. For our pitch to Grand River Hospital and Velocity investors, I even put together a demo proving compressed air could lift a car, showing our concept was not just viable, but powerful.

The project isn't over. Leveraging my robotics background, I am currently exploring how to integrate LiDAR technology for non-contact, privacy-preserving detection of patient movement. We are also exploring a number of sensors to embed within the bedsheets to monitor temperature, humidity, and pressure to create a real-time distribution map. The goal is to provide nurses with a deeper, data-driven understanding of a patient's condition, helping them prevent pressure ulcers before they even begin to form.

Pitching our solution and seeing people believe in our story was incredibly motivating. To me, "dreaming big" isn't about chasing flashy tech; it's about finding simple, genuine solutions to real human problems. It’s about remembering who I build for: my family, my neighbors, and my community. I believe the most meaningful impact comes from creating things that people genuinely need, and bAIRiatric Supports is more than a project; it’s a reflection of my passion for building a better future with empathy, for people like my grandfather.

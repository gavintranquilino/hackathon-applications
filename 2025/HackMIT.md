# HackMIT 2025 Application

## Tell us about your background. Have you coded before, or do you have other skills that you hope to use during the hackathon weekend? [900 chars]
### You do not need coding experience to attend HackMIT. We'd also love to hear about any other skills (related to art, music, hardware, design) you'd like to use at HackMIT.

I'm student with a passion for building things that make you go "wow". My journey started in high school, inspired by Her, and has since evolved into expertise across multiple languages: C++, Docker, and ROS2 for robotics, Python for AI and CV, TS and React for web development, and hardware with Arduino and STM32.

I bring strong hardware design skills using Fusion360, 3D printing, and prototyping skills. I've built everything from smart home systems to CV wearables, combining mechanical design with software integration.

My interdisciplinary approach means I can tackle projects requiring both hardware and software components. I excel at system design, having led winning teams in hackathons, and enjoy the problem solving that comes with building novel solutions.

I'm ready to leverage my full stack capabilities and leadership experience to create something innovative and impactful.

## Write about a time when you worked in a team. What were your strengths and weaknesses? What role did you play? [900 chars]
I led a team of 5 interdisciplinary students for Velocity's health tech innovation challenge, developing a bariatric patient support system. Our project required hardware prototyping, 3D printing, microcontrollers, web dev, and presentation.

My greatest strength was leadership and system design. I excelled at identifying each team member's strengths and assigning focused goals that aligned with their skills. I structured our workflow effectively, ensuring everyone knew their responsibilities and deadlines.

However, my weakness was taking on too much. While giving tasks, I found myself doing additional work: handling 3D printing, creating the website, and overseeing the presentation.

However, our collaboration succeeded. We won the health tech innovation challenge, proving that clear leadership and strong teamwork can overcome individual weaknesses when everyone contributes their best.

## What draws you to hackathons, and how do you hope HackMIT will help you grow? [900 chars]
What draws me to hackathons is the energy and fast paced environment where ideas transform into reality over a weekend. Unlike school where I'm restricted by grades, hackathons offer freedom to build anything. I thrive in this unrestricted space where I can finally tackle my backlog of project ideas.

Collaborating with other cracked people excites me most. I want to work with passionate hackers who share the same drive to create something meaningful. I get immediate feedback from peers and judges, making it the perfect environment to validate my ideas.

HackMIT represents an opportunity to push boundaries and explore new tech in a supportive community. I'm excited about the learning opportunities and networking potential, as hackathons have consistently opened doors to new skills and connections that extend far beyond the weekend event itself :)


## Share a project that you're proud of, technical or non-technical! [900 chars]
### How and what did you learn in the process of working on this project? How did you take advantage of resources around you to make it happen?

My favorite project is "Blink Twice if You Need Help," a safety computer vision wearable. The idea started as a joke from TikTok comments, but I thought it would be hilarious to make it real. A blink detection system for emergency situations where calling 911 is too risky.

I learned basic computer vision techniques without machine learning OpenCV for the first time with my teammate. We spent significant time planning and building flowcharts for our data workflow, having a clear vision of the problem we were solving.

We used hackathon resources: Twilio's sponsorship provided Python integration for phone calls, and my teammate's dorm had hardware materials. We successfully mounted a webcam on a cap for blink detection.

The project taught me that unconventional solutions can address real problems, and seeing people's reactions to our novel but functional prototype was super satisfying.

## What do you think is the most important trait for a hacker to have and why? (400 characters)

Curiosity. Being a hacker means embracing innovation and exploring new ideas. True change comes from pushing beyond the ordinary and surpassing our limits. We are open to trying new approaches and styles, connecting what we know with what we have yet to learn. Curiosity is the attitude that bridges the gap between knowledge and the unknown, propelling our creativity and problem solving abilities.

## What is one of your favourite things you've built, created, or worked on? Why did you do it and why are you proud of it? (1200 characters)

One of my favorite projects is a smart home system I'm currently working on. Tired of going down my bunk bed to turn on/off lights, I built a digital solution. I decided to use an old LED lamp, which I stripped down to its wires. I taught myself soldering and wiring to create a simple transistor switch circuit, controlled by an Arduino. I then programmed it to turn the lights on and off and connected it to a Discord bot for my friends to manipulate remotely. Additionally, instead of altering the house's electric parts, I devised an original idea to use a servo mount for digital control while maintaining manual usage. I learned all these skills on my own as a self taught tinkerer/developer, conceptualizing the hardware using Fusion360 and 3D printing the servo housing. I taught myself Python and how to set up a web app on a Raspberry Pi accessible online with ngrok. There were numerous skills that I did not expect to learn such as how to use SSH to connect remotely to a network. This smart home project is my favorite as it allowed me to acquire numerous skills, igniting a passion for working with software and hardware alike. The link I give has both of these projects separately.

## What would dreaming big at Hack the North look like for you? (400 characters)

Novelty. I think the projects that stand out the most are not necessarily the most technical, but solve an otherwise overlooked problem in a unique way. Whether it be: satire, serious, or fun, ideas that make you go, "I should've thought of that", is something that I strive for. My version of dreaming big involves a project that makes people do a double-take with how unexpected our hack is.

## Tell us about something you worked on that brought a passion to life. What inspired you to get started? (1200 characters)

One of my favorite projects is my safety computer vision wearable, "Blink Twice if You Need Help." I'm passionate about wearable tech; it makes me feel like Iron Man, allowing me to finish digital tasks while I move. I also have a fondness for silly ideas and am a big fan of Michael Reeves, so I love tackling unconventional, but useful, projects.

The idea for this project started as a joke. I've seen TikToks where people made cringey brain rot, and comments joked about blinking twice if they needed help. I thought it would be hilarious if I could make it real. The premise was simple: if you were in a hostage situation where calling 911 on your phone was too risky, you could use a blink detection system to call for help. The final product consisted of a webcam mounted on a cap and we used OpenCV to detect blinks; it was absurd, but seeing it go from concept to completion and watching people react to it was so satisfying.

The project served as a novel proof of concept for a real problem. I'm proud since it shows that challenging norms and approaching problems with unconventional solutions can lead to refreshing and useful ideas.

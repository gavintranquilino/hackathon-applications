# DeltaHacks is the annual Hackathon for Change. If you had the ability to change anything in the world, what would it be and why?

If I had the power to change anything in the world, it would be people's perception of AI. There's a prevalent fear surrounding the widespread use of AI technologies and the threat it poses to jobs. My belief is that we should embrace this groundbreaking technology, recognizing its potential to automate tasks that people typically don't want to do, like jobs in fast food restaurants or custodial jobs (though much respect for those that do have these jobs). AI can open up new opportunities in tech related fields, and that's why I'm pursuing a program in mechatronics. I aim to hone my skills in both mechanical and software aspects to put AI tools to practical use in the real world.

# How do you hope to make the most out of your experience at DH10?

At DH10, I am pumped to team up with other skilled hackers, broaden my network, and crank out a project that's not only compelling, but also a great talking point for future reference. I am very interested in taking a dive into the AI space and learning its many uses and applications in my own projects. I can't wait to check out the wild projects others come up with and dive headfirst into the weekend, soaking up a ton of new and exciting tech along the way. It's all about hands on learning for me.

# Which piece of future technology excites you most and where do you see it going?

I'm particularly enthusiastic about Large Language Models (LLMs) as a piece of future technology. The way AI becomes more accessible to individuals without coding expertise intrigues me. We can simply interact with complex digital systems with natural language. That's why I believe that gadgets and digital assistants like Google Home or Amazon Alexa are so widespread; it just is so easily usable by anyone without any programming knowledge barrier. Simplifying technology usage is crucial for widespread adoption, and natural language interfaces empower people to interact with advanced technologies effortlessly. This aligns with my vision for changing the world, where technology, including AI, becomes more user friendly. The ease with which users can witness the results and power of this technology is a key driver for its widespread growth.

# You've been transported to an island with no clue of where you are. You are allowed 3 objects of your choice which will magically appear in front of you. How would you escape the island in time for DeltaHacks 10?

My three essential items would be internet access (a router maybe), a laptop with a reliable power source, and access to OpenAI GPT-4. While calling for a plane would be too easy, and too expensive, I would instead get myself the required items to escape the island. To escape and make it to DeltaHacks 10 in time, I would leverage these resources to create an AI agent using GPT-4, essentially having my own personal Bear Grylls. This AI agent could help me with island survival, resource collection, teaching me essential skills, and even coordinating tasks like calling for transportation once I reach the mainland. I would use technologies like open interpreter to use LLMs to call me an Uber while I'm asleep or busy building a boat. Information in this case would be so much easier to access with the help with simple GPTs.

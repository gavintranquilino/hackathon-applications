Dreaming big at Hack the North involves pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Developing projects that explore the farther reaches of fields, in order to discover unique solutions to varying challenges. Expanding my understanding through an exploration of different fields and producing an impactful project is the ultimate goal.

# Tell us about something you worked on that brought a passion to life. What inspired you to get started? (1200 characters)

During my high school years, I was fascinated by AI and its potential applications. As such I created a project that I could use to explain some basic principles to my peers. The project was not part of any curriculum, but something I sought to do out of pure curiosity. I truly wanted to understand the inner-workings and experience the magic first-hand. The project sparked a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence, and it resulted in me forcing AI into completely different subjects. I went as far as to discuss the premise of Quantum Machine Learning in Physics, and the Ethics of AI in Religion. I was so engrossed in the topic, that one presentation resulted in me talking for an entire class period. The project was something I enjoyed working on and presenting. 

The main inspiration for my initial interest in AI were videos uploaded by CodeBullet. Seeing Artificial Intelligence learn to complete tasks was something that truly compelled me to learn more. Watching AI learn to complete simple tasks led me to wonder what else a computer program can learn to do and achieve.

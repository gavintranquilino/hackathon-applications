# If you could instantly master any hobby, what would it be and why? (150 words)
Blacksmithing. There's something about working with your hands, creating something tangible that you can hold. I love soldering for the same reason. It's meditative, precise, genuinely satisfying. Computers and automation are cool but there's this irreplaceable value in actual human craftsmanship. 

What really gets me is the idea of combining blacksmithing with my engineering skills. You'd have this artisan-engineer who can forge and design intelligent tools, hardware that's both beautiful and functional. Ancient metalwork paired with modern tech. I think that combination is unstoppable.

It's not just about the skill itself, but about bridging two worlds. The timeless tradition of craftsmanship and the endless possibilities of technology. That's what captivates me about it.

# Why do you want to be a part of DeltaHacks 12? (150 words)
I've been to DeltaHacks 10 and 11, and honestly, it's been incredible. What makes DeltaHacks different is the space it creates for novelty and bold ideas. Like, you can bring something weird or unconventional and instead of getting weird looks, people actually get hyped about it. It challenges what people think is possible to build.

A big part of it too is the tradition I've built with my friends. Patrick and I have made it a thing where we come up with these silly, quirky projects that stand out. "Blink Twice If You Need Help" and "Dora's Backpack" were just two examples. There's something special about DeltaHacks because it rewards that kind of thinking.

I want to be part of DeltaHacks 12 because I want to keep building in that space. It's where we get to break the norm and make something that people haven't seen before. Plus, Adam keeps pushing us to come back, and honestly, I'm here for it.


# Talk about a topic that can make you lose track of time, why does it captivate you? (150 words)
Right to repair. I could talk about this for hours, honestly. 

The problem is that consumers don't actually own what they buy anymore. Your earphones, your smartwatch, your car. Companies can just shut them down with a software update. And I get it for software, but hardware? That should be yours. You should own it, understand how it works, be able to fix it if something breaks.

This is why I build the way I do. I'm a hardware hacker, and my goal is to make devices that people can actually own and modify. Not locked down. Not controlled by some corporation on the other side of the world.

What captivates me is the idea of giving people back control. When you can repair your own stuff, you're not just a consumer anymore. You're a maker. You have power. That shift is what I'm building toward.

# Describe a situation where you had to quickly learn a new skill or technology to solve a problem. What was your approach and what did you learn from it? (150 words)
At my most recent hackathon I built a smartwatch with a friend. But not your typical smartwatch. Most smartwatches are all about showing you stuff on a screen, right? I wanted to build one that's about *doing* things. A wearable that executes tasks with a button press instead of eating your battery with a display.

Problem? I'd never worked with LiPo batteries, power systems, or ESP32s before. So we just jumped in. Found tutorials, looked at Instructables projects, consulted LLMs for code boilerplate, experimented with different ESP32 variants. We didn't wait to become experts first.

We chose a compact shell model to fit a tiny button cell battery, messed with Arduino vs ESP-IDF frameworks, and actually got an MVP working. 

What I learned was that the biggest barrier to building something isn't lack of knowledge. It's hesitation. Starting messy and learning as you go beats spending hours planning. You just gotta jump in and see what sticks.



# If you did not have to worry about school/money/time, what is the one thing you would work on? (150 words)
Building an open-source smartwatch platform.

Right now the market feels hollow. You've got mechanical watches or you're locked into Apple, Garmin, some closed ecosystem.

If I had unlimited time and resources, I'd create a smartwatch where anyone could repair it, customize it, modify it. It would need both hardware design and solid software, but that's what makes it interesting.

I want to build a platform where developers can contribute, where consumers aren't passive users but actual participants in how it evolves. The smartwatch market is ripe for disruption, and I genuinely think an open-source alternative could change how people think about wearables.

It's the ultimate version of right to repair. Giving people back control over the tech they wear every day.

# Is there anything else interesting you want us to know or see? (150 words)
I'm coming to DeltaHacks 12 with Patrick Gaied, another friend from high school. We've made it a tradition since starting university to hit up all our local hackathons together. It's just become a thing for us now. Adam Suljak was actually the one who introduced me to DeltaHacks in the first place. He keeps pushing us to come back, which is cool because he genuinely cares about the community.

The past two years at DH 10 and 11 have been a blast. We've tried to bring something unique to the table, projects like "Blink Twice If You Need Help" and "Dora's Backpack" that are silly but actually useful. This year we're hyped to do it again.

DeltaHacks isn't just another event for us anymore. It's where we learned to embrace unconventional thinking and build weird stuff without worrying about what's "normal." That means something.

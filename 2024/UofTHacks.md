Curious mechatronics enthusiast, a jack of all trades in tech

# How do you hope to make the most out of your experience at UofTHacks? (500 characters)

I'm excited to dive into a collaborative hacking environment. Since my first hackathon, I've been eager to return, driven by the opportunity to create projects with a team and explore the latest technologies. The idea of dedicating an entire weekend to hacking alongside top-notch hackers, engineers, and designers excites me. As an undergrad, it's a great chance to bring to life the projects I haven't had the opportunity to tackle during school.

# Describe a situation in which you learned something new quickly. How did you approach the learning process? (600 Characters)

As a mechatronics engineering student unfamiliar with AI, I dove head first into learning at least a thing or two about AI Agents at my most recent AI Agents hackathon. Tasked with using LMQL, I quickly sought tutorials, mentor advice, and input from experienced hackers. Never having dealt with OpenAI API, I immersed myself in my own crash course. I found that making demos accelerated my understanding significantly. Working hands-on diving deep into unknown territory is where I thrive and get the most out of learning. I hope to apply my knowledge to create an AI agent project for UofThacks! 

# OPTIONAL: What is important for you to see at UofTHacks? Do you have any suggestions for games, workshops, or other activities?

At UofTHacks, what matters most to me is meaningful networking. Games are enjoyable, but lasting connections are crucial. Team building at the start is useful. At HacktheNorth, QR code tags for instant social media connections are efficient. I value hands-on workshops over talks, with interest in AI Agents and embedded systems. In the end though, web development workshops and hackpacks benefit both beginners and experienced hackers. Looking forward to this

# Please describe your involvement with Hack the North 500 words maximum

My first hackathon experience was at HackTheNorth 2023, and it quickly became one of the highlights of my first year at university. I teamed up with upper-year engineering students from the University of Waterloo, and their support helped me ease into my first term. Our focus during the hackathon was a project called Psych Tracker, aiming to address mental health issues through a hardware-based solution. I took on the hardware side of things, encountering a few hurdles along the way. To overcome them, we attended workshops like the embedded systems session and a ChatGPT workshop, which turned out to be pretty useful. It feels like access to talks that feel like TED Talks but tailored specifically to the tech topics that pique my interest. The event wasn't just about our project; it was also a chance to collect swag at sponsor booths and connect with others through QR codes (this was a fun feature). A memorable twist happened when I celebrated my birthday at HackTheNorth, surrounded by new friends who shared the same passion for innovation. I am glad to have spent my birthday literally doing what I love most. 

Participating in HackTheNorth 2023 was a game changer for me. Initially, I was into complex and technically impressive projects, thinking that was the way to go. However, the hackathon experience opened my eyes to the importance of practical problem solving. It made me realize that the standout projects weren't necessarily the most complex ones. Instead, they were clever solutions addressing real world problems that may not be obvious at first glance. This shift in thinking didn't just stay confined to the hackathon but seeped into my everyday life. I started looking at problems not just from my perspective but also from the viewpoint of others. I began jotting down issues I came across and brainstorming ways to use what I knew to fix them. After HackTheNorth, I actively sought out projects from other hackathons to see how people were using new technologies to tackle real problems. It wasn't about how technically impressive something was; it was about creating solutions that made people go, "Why haven't I thought of that before?" This change in perspective stuck with me and became a source of inspiration. Now, I'm committed to generating ideas that bring about that shared realization of unaddressed problems. 

This first hackathon left me hooked on the fast paced environment and the challenge of creating something meaningful over a weekend. Since then, I've attended about five more hackathons, even winning one focused on AI Agents. I owe my newfound love for hackathons to HackTheNorth, and now, if time allows, I try to attend one almost every other weekend.

In a nutshell, my involvement with HackTheNorth wasn't just about a weekend project. It kickstarted my ongoing enthusiasm for hackathons, teaching me the ropes of collaboration and problem solving in the tech world. The experience didn't just open doors to new skills but also to a community of like minded hackers.

My passion for creating, simply for the joy of building, ignited long before my venture into hackathons. I had a list of project ideas meticulously curated, waiting for the right moment to see the light. School was often an excuse; a seemingly insurmountable obstacle preventing me from bringing my ideas to life. While generating concepts was a breeze, I found it most challenging taking that initial step mainly because of the fear of starting, doubting my own skill set, and believing I did not have enough time.

The experience obliterated the misconception that I needed prerequisite knowledge of each skill before embarking on a project; I never worked with computer vision before, but I greatly appreciated mentorship from my teammates for our project. This misconception became evident when tackling my ambitious idea of creating a desktop pet with natural language processing, computer vision, a custom PCB, and self sourced parts. I doubted my current skill set, comparing myself to peers proficient in AI/ML or deploying full stack web applications independently. The prospect of lacking these skills demotivated me from delving into the projects I envisioned. Unfortunately for a period of time since 12th grade, I found myself in this vicious cycle of doubt and essentially drained the fun out of the project to begin with.

HackTheNorth, however, served as a turning point. It ingrained in me the understanding that learning is intrinsic to the act of making. While I may not possess the prerequisites for crafting a custom PCB or delving into the intricacies of computer vision at this moment, the key lies in initiating the project and acquiring knowledge organically along the way. This experience made me realize that the reason I have a long list of project ideas is because I enjoy the thought of making them. I had momentarily forgotten that my passion is deeply rooted in the learning process. The desire to impress others with complex technical projects was overshadowing my love for the design and creation stages of a project.

In essence, my journey reflects a love for making driven by the sheer joy of building. It's about embracing the process, learning through creation, and finding satisfaction in bringing ideas to life, one project at a time. Importantly, I discovered that being alone in this cycle of self comparison was detrimental. Participating in hackathons and group projects during my first term at university highlighted the impact of a supportive community. Experiencing the joy of gaining mentorship or assistance in areas where I lacked proficiency showed me the fallacy of my belief that the right skill set was a prerequisite for projects. The strength of a community lies in collaboration, and what I cherish about the hackathon community and engineering at large is the ability to collaborate. Learning from one another has proven to be one of the most valuable experiences, emphasizing the importance of a community where all skills are valued, and skill levels are appreciated, fostering genuine learning over a maliciously competitive environment.

Thanks for having me, I am really honored to even be talking to you all today.

How do you explain to someone what a hackathon is? My name is Gavin, a Mechatronics student in my first year, and I've attended 8 hackathons since starting university. HackTheNorth 2023 was my first, since then I have created numerous projects such as an AI Agent wearable, Mental Health Buddy, and my favorite project: Blink Twice if You Need Help.

I asked myself the same question. What even is a hackathon?
I had the luxury of celebrating my birthday at HackTheNorth. I remember struggling to explain to my parents why I wanted to. But as I soldered buttons next to strangers turned friends at 11:59pm on the second day, I realized it was about more than just a nerd convention. It was a newchapter-defining experience that not only helped me land my first internship and exposure to new technologies, but also allowed me to connect with people beyond my class.

I saw firsthand that hackathons bring together people of varied backgrounds with one common goal: to build something meaningful. It's inspiring to see hundreds of projects and ideas come to life, exposing participants to new skills and perspectives.

I've come to believe that true knowledge is not just about what you know, but about being aware of what you don't know. And it's essential for people early in their careers, like myself, to have access to these resources. That's why I'm working to expand the reach of hackathons and have even been invited back to my high school to share my experiences, hoping to inspire others to join in and build community through technology. 

I have pulled in my friends from high school to join hackathons with me. I've also been working offline on both creating a newsletter and tracker for upcoming hackathons geared for high school students as I would have wished I had access to this information at the time. Despite prizes involved, if I had the opportunity to attend a hackathon in high school, it would've pushed me that one step further in motivating me to build the projects I have always wanted.

Thank you.

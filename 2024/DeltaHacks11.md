# Describe an incident that reshaped your approach to teamwork, leadership, or maintaining a positive outlook. (150 words)

I was a robotics team lead, preparing for Skills Ontario's robotics competition. Our challenge was to build a hockey-playing robot, but unlike other teams with VEX kits and full funding, we had a simple machine shop, drill batteries, spare sheet metal, Arduinos, and old soldering irons. My six teammates and I organised our own meetings, rotating ideas for the robot's design and brainstorming how to compete with limited resources.

After a month of hard work dividing coding, electrical, and mechanical tasks, we still lagged behind some teams with fully autonomous robots. At the event, we had to think on our feet, adapting the scope of our design, ordering last-minute parts, and even soldering repairs between matches. Ultimately, we built a functional differential drive robot with a hockey stick, controlled by a wireless PS2 controller. Although we didn't win, this experience was pivotal in shaping my approach to teamwork and leadership. I learned that assessing constraints and planning effectively are crucial, but even more so is understanding each team member's strengths and aligning them with the project's needs. Regardless of resources, fostering creativity and adaptability allows any team to turn limited tools into tangible achievements.

# How will you make the most out of your experience at DeltaHacks 11, and how will attending the event help you achieve your long-term goals? (150 words)

I am a hardware enthusiast who thrives in the fast-paced, high-energy environment of hackathons, where meaningful projects come to life over a single weekend. I have been looking forward to DeltaHacks since last year's experience, and I'm excited to tackle new challenges, work with fresh themes, and collaborate with a new set of people.

At DeltaHacks, I aim to create something unique; something that isn't necessarily the most common solution, but solves an overlooked problem in a clever way. I believe the most impactful projects are those that make people think, "I wish I'd thought of that!" Whether our project is serious, satirical, or just plain fun, I want it to showcase what we're capable of. I'll push the boundaries of our tools and build something with a "wow" factor that adds to my portfolio of inventive and practical projects.

# What's your go-to comfort food? (150 words)

I'm all about Wagyu beef tartare with Beluga caviar and a side of Himalayan pink salt chips! On a bad day though, I'll probably have a delicate foie gras parfait topped with white truffle shavings and a sprinkling of 24k gold leaf. Nothing says comfort like edible gold!

# If you could travel anywhere in the universe, where would you go and why? (150 words)

I'd visit a parallel Earth in a multiverse where society has developed entirely new forms of technology and problem-solving. I'd want to learn how they've approached issues like sustainability, health, and communication and see if their methods could be adapted here. I imagine it literally as a fresh new perspective on everything that we do.

# If you did not have to worry about school/money/time, what is the one thing you would work on? (150 words)

If I didn't have to worry about school, money, or time, I would focus on travelling the world. As an aspiring engineer, I believe it's crucial to address problems faced by real people, not just ones I assume they have. Travelling would allow me to immerse myself in different cultures, experiencing both the good and the bad. To build meaningful solutions, I need to understand the real world problems I aim to solve. For example, how could I create tools for the blind if I've never met someone who is blind or fully grasped the challenges they face? The same applies to global issues. I want to understand the people I'm building for, so I can create more impactful solutions. If I could eliminate the constraints of time and money, this would be my top priority.

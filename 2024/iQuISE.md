# Please tell us a little more about your background.

Mechatronics engineer and entrepreneur, I offer a robust skill set to iQuHACK 2024. My high school quantum computing project reflects a persistent interest. While not an expert, my proactive problem-solving and interdisciplinary approach contribute a valuable perspective. I aim to leverage my engineering background to actively engage and collaborate within the iQuHACK community, focusing on the convergence of quantum information science and engineering.

# Why interested in attending

Eager to attend iQuHACK to collectively explore new frontiers in quantum computing. As a mechatronics engineer, I seek to deepen my knowledge and contribute to the iQuHACK community's quantum journey. Ready to dive into new technologies and embrace the dynamic intersection of engineering and quantum exploration.

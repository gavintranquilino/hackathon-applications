# What are you excited about and what are your goals for SerenityHacks?

Eager to join SerenityHacks and push the boundaries of tech and wellness. Inspired by my passion for expanding IoT NLP for smart home devices, I previously participated in an AI Agent hackathon. Excited about SerenityHacks as an avenue to explore more AI integrations and projects. Looking forward to the weekend sprint, networking, attending workshops, and collaboratively building innovative AI Agent applications that promote wellness. Ready for a memorable 36 hours of creativity and tech exploration!

# Anything else?

Absolutely thrilled to share that my ongoing passion project since the start of my hacking journey revolves around a comprehensive smart home system. Starting with rudimentary 3D printed mechanical parts and a Raspberry Pi for the web server, this project has evolved significantly. Building on the knowledge gained from winning the AI Agents hackathon for using LMQL for LLM scripting, I'm integrating natural language processing to seamlessly convert user commands into post-processed interpreted instructions, simplifying code manipulation. Excitement for the AI space is rooted in enhancing user experience within intricate mechanical systems. A core reason for why I chose mechatronics engineering. Can't wait to delve into these topics at SerenityHacks!

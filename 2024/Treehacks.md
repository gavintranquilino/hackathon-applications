# Why do you want to come to TreeHacks 2024?

I'm excited about attending TreeHacks 2024 to dive into a collaborative hacking environment. Since my first hackathon, I've been eager to return, driven by the opportunity to create projects with a team and explore the latest technologies. The idea of dedicating an entire weekend to hacking at Stanford University alongside top-notch hackers, engineers, and designers excites me. As an undergraduate student, it's a great chance to bring to life projects I haven't had the opportunity to tackle during school. Busied with academics and job search, hackathons provide a space for me to unleash a flow of ideas and witness the application of cutting-edge technologies, especially in AI. I thrive in environments where creativity is incentivized, and the idea of building something significant over a weekend is compelling. I look forward to connecting with fellow hackers at TreeHacks, collaborating on projects, and delving into the fascinating world of software applications.

# Tell us about a project you've enjoyed working on, technical or non-technical.

I am passionate about developing an open-source smart home system. Frustrated with the inconvenience of accessing lights from my bunk bed, I devised a digital solution by repurposing an old LED lamp. I learned circuits and soldering to modify it for control via an Arduino and programmed it to respond to a Discord bot for my friends. Instead of altering the house's electrical components, I constructed a servo mount for both digital and manual control. I gained skills in hardware using Fusion360, 3D printed the servo housing, and learned Python. This open-source smart home project has become my favorite, offering a rewarding learning experience and fueling my passion for both software and hardware. My long-term goal is to create an open-source system accommodating various smart devices. Currently, I'm connecting my other smart home systems and working on an AI agent for seamless natural language interaction within this open-source framework.

# What's something you're excited to work on in the next 10 years? Dream big!

In the next decade, I'm excited about working on one of the startup ideas I've been brewing. Inspired by brilliant concepts observed in hackathons, I envision delving into compelling new technologies and applications. My focus lies in AI assistants, particularly in advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) to simplify interactions with smart devices using natural language. As an aspiring mechatronics engineer, my dream is to integrate my passion for the rapidly growing AI field into real-world mechanical applications. Ultimately, I aspire to contribute to projects as futuristic as Ironman's utilization of Jarvis.

# Tell us a fun fact about you :)

I'm obsessed with the show Mr. Robot. It's the inspiration behind my coding journey. Elliot's digital literacy and technical skills resonate with everything I aspire to be. Beyond cybersecurity, Elliot is the jack of all trades I aim to become.

# I would describe myself as aâ€¦

Mr. Robot Inspired Tech Enthusiast 

# Is there anything else that we should know about you? (optional!)

As a mechatronics engineer, my expertise lies in embedded systems and low-level applications using C and C++. Despite my specialization, recent hackathons have spurred my interest in full-stack engineering. I aspire to be a jack of all trades, enjoying the challenge of developing various software applications with a team over a weekend. I'm self-taught in Python, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, and AWS. Currently, I'm building a personal project portfolio using Figma for the frontend and learning Next.js. Excited to hone these skills and create awe-inspiring apps at TreeHacks!

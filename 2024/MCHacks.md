# Why McHacks?

Having participated in various hackathons, such as HackTheNorth, my enthusiasm for collaborative hacking environments has only grown stronger. McHacks presents an exciting opportunity to dive into a fast paced atmosphere, surrounded by like minded hackers, engineers, and designers. 

I love the idea of dedicating a whole weekend to hacking, collaborating with top tier hackers, and delving into the latest technologies. This hackathon provides a space for me to unleash my creativity, work on compelling projects, and bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications. I find that hackathons are my favourite way to spend my weekends to grind out those projects that I have been hoping to get building but just don't have the time for during the week.

As an undergraduate student, McHacks offers a valuable chance to bring to life projects that may have been on the back burner during the academic hustle. The intensity and focus of a hackathon weekend, free from the usual academic constraints, empower me to explore new ideas and witness the real world application of cutting edge technologies.

I'm particularly drawn to the learning experience and networking opportunities that hackathons offer. McHacks provides an ideal environment for me to not only broaden my skill set but also connect with fellow hackers and expand my professional network. 

My interest in exploring the AI space further fuels my excitement for McHacks. The chance to delve into artificial intelligence, understand its uses, and integrate it into my projects is a compelling aspect of this hackathon. I look forward to immersing myself in the wild and innovative projects that fellow participants bring to the table, soaking up new and exciting technologies along the way.

# What are you passionate about?

I'm passionate about bringing my ideas to life. Whenever I encounter a new problem, I constantly seek to ideate a new solution. I am passionate about bringing my innovative ideas to life. My journey into creating a smart home system using an old LED lamp is a testament to my love for building. Stripping down the lamp to its wires, mastering soldering and wiring, and crafting a transistor switch circuit controlled by an Arduino was a hands-on learning experience.

What gets me excited is the prospect of becoming my own Iron Man. My very first mechatronics related smart home project is just one manifestation of this vision, where I not only learned to manipulate hardware but also programmed the system to respond to a Discord bot for remote control. The ingenious use of a servo mount for digital control while retaining manual functionality showcases my creative problem-solving approach.

My interest in AI, especially in Large Language Models (LLMs) is something that I find that excites me for every hackathon. I envision simplifying interactions with smart devices through natural language, aligning with my mechatronics engineering focus. The dream of creating an open-source smart home system that accommodates various devices reflects my commitment to building practical and impactful solutions.

Participating in hackathons, such as the AI Agents hackathon, showcases my eagerness to dive into new technologies quickly. I'm not afraid to deep dive into unknown tools, seeking tutorials, advice, and hands on experience to accelerate my learning.

I'm passionate about bringing my ideas to life, driven by a vision to create, innovate, and contribute to the ever evolving tech space.

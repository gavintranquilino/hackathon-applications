we are bariatric supports we're an interdisciplinary team of engineering health and science students one out of every four patients developed some form of pressure injury during their Hospital stay and not only are the patients at risk but the healthcare workers too since 50% of musculoskeletal injuries in the staff are caused by patient handling and of those injuries 30% are caused specifically by bariatric patients this is typically caused by the sheer and sliding of slings underneath bariatric patient these slings are used for the lifts to get them from one place to another and also the manual labor that's required in the rolling and sling fitting of patients causes stress in the healthcare workers typically in the hospital each bariatric patient needs to be repositioned every 2 hours you need two nurses per patient to reposition a patient 12 times a day this amounts to around a million working hours spent on reposition iing annually and this is at Grand River Hospital alone and from those hours you're wasting about $40 million just on these repositioning hours we aim to reduce the number of nurses required for repositioning from two nurses to one so our solution bariatric supports features inflatable air bladders under existing hospital bed sheets that will Aid in the rotation the repositioning of patients and sling fitting we provide a scalable affordable and modular solution to add on to any kind of bed we aim to protect delicate skin support bariatric patients reduce strain on nurses and improve cost Effectiveness existing mechanized beds that provide the lateral tilting these go for around 20,000 to $40,000 and these require replacement of the current beds since the mattresses themselves have to fold and the beds themselves have to TI entirely however our air bladders can be
attached to any kind of bed and go for less than $200 per unit here's a top down view of our proposed idea so beneath the patient underneath the bed sheets so that they're not in contact with the inflatable portions will have two sections of of inflatable sections and once inflated you can get a patient to around a 30° tilt and we've done some research and it turns out that the 30° is optimal to relieve pressure and this can be repeated every 2 hours on either side reducing the need for manual labor entirely here's a cross-section view as well of our proposed sling fitting idea since underneath the patient you have two sections of inflatable wedges you can inflate either side T in Tandem and you can get them from their Supine position which is the patient laying face up onto their lateral side and once they're on their l lateral side you can deflate one of those sides and place the sling underneath so that the patient can roll back over on Top This avoids all shearing and sliding which causes lots of friction for the patient on the right here is the bed the pink part is the patient's pillow and each inflatable section is highlighted right there so this is some this is the website that the staff will be able to see either a website or an app they can log in as a nurse log in with their password and this is their patient dashboard room Number bed and ID and specifically the time since last reposition every 2 hours the nurse will be notified to flip and set this patient on their side so they can set them to 30° now the pressure has been redistributed same for the right side the other two hours and they can even set their own angle as you noticed the time the timer has reset so the next 2 hours they'll be able to flip them again all right and that was our prototype our physical prototype with our patient dashboard which can both work as a web app or a mobile app if you want to see the results and sort of our process right after we just finished check out Suki's video through this QR code it's also on YouTube if you want to see more
